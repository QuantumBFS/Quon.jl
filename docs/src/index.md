### X Fusion

### Perm Rz

![perm](assets/perm_rz.png)

We only consider the pattern on the LHS for now.

### Identity

![](assets/identity.png)

The phase of an edge is approximately zero.

### Genus Fusion

### Swap Genus

![](assets/swap_genus.png)

This rule is from the 3D diagram, we force removing one of the genus of a swap operator since they are the same operator
in the 3D diagram. Might should revisit the 3D diagram skeleton graph idea later.
